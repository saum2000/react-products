# React Products

This repository contains the user interface (UI) implementation for a basic e-commerce application built using Vite, React, and TypeScript. The application integrates with a dummy data API to showcase product listings, basic filters, and a shopping cart page with subtotal calculation.

## Features

- Display of product listings with images, titles, prices, and categories.
- Basic filtering functionality by product category.
- Shopping cart page displaying added products with quantities and subtotal calculation.

## Technologies Used

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/): A fast, opinionated web dev build tool that serves your code via native ES modules.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/): A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.

3. Start the development server:
